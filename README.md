# Visualizing L-Systems with Turtle Graphics 

https://turtle-graphics.vercel.app/

Drawing a variety of Lindenmayer systems, (L-systems) with turtle graphics using WebGL and React. 

Turtle graphics can be thought of as programming a pen to move around the page, keeping track of position, direction, and style. 

You can also save and restore previous pen states on a stack to enable more complex drawing. 

This visualizer currently supports the following:
- Control line length and number of iterations applied
- Supports preset shapes like fractal trees, fractal plants, sierpinski triangles, and dragon curves
- Includes custom rule-setting to visualize your own language
