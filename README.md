# Visualizing L-Systems with Turtle Graphics 

https://turtle-graphics.vercel.app/

Drawing a variety of Lindenmayer systems, (L-systems) with turtle graphics using WebGL and React. 

Turtle graphics programs a pen (or turtle) to move around the page, keeping track of position, direction, and style. You can also save and restore previous pen states on a stack to enable more complex drawing. 

This visualizer currently supports the following:
- Control line length and number of iterations applied
- Preset shapes like fractal trees, fractal plants, sierpinski triangles, and dragon curves
- Custom rule-setting to visualize your own language
